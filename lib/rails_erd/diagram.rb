module RailsERD
  # This class is an abstract class that will process a domain model and
  # allows easy creation of diagrams. To implement a new diagram type, derive
  # from this class and override +process_entity+, +process_relationship+, 
  # and (optionally) +save+.
  #
  # As an example, a diagram class that generates code that can be used with
  # yUML (http://yuml.me) can be as simple as:
  #
  #   require "rails_erd/diagram"
  #
  #   class YumlDiagram < RailsERD::Diagram
  #     def process_relationship(rel)
  #       return if rel.indirect?
  #
  #       arrow = case
  #       when rel.cardinality.one_to_one?   then "1-1>"
  #       when rel.cardinality.one_to_many?  then "1-*>"
  #       when rel.cardinality.many_to_many? then "*-*>"
  #       end
  #
  #       instructions << "[#{rel.source}] #{arrow} [#{rel.destination}]"
  #     end
  #
  #     def save
  #       instructions * "\n"
  #     end
  #
  #     def instructions
  #       @instructions ||= []
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # Then, to generate the diagram (example based on the domain model of Gemcutter):
  #
  #   YumlDiagram.create
  #   #=> "[Rubygem] 1-*> [Ownership]
  #   #    [Rubygem] 1-*> [Subscription]
  #   #    [Rubygem] 1-*> [Version]
  #   #    [Rubygem] 1-1> [Linkset]
  #   #    [Rubygem] 1-*> [Dependency]
  #   #    [Version] 1-*> [Dependency]
  #   #    [User] 1-*> [Ownership]
  #   #    [User] 1-*> [Subscription]
  #   #    [User] 1-*> [WebHook]"
  #
  # For another example implementation, see Diagram::Graphviz, which is the
  # default (and currently only) diagram type that is used by Rails ERD.

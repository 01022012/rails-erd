<p>
  <strong>Rails ERD</strong> is a plugin for <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>
  that generates diagrams based on your Active Record models.
  
  Such an <strong>entity-relationship diagram</strong> gives an overview of your models
  and how they are associated. Browse through <a href="/gallery.html">example diagrams</a>,
  or read the <a href="/install.html">installation instructions</a>.
</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>
  Rails ERD loads your Active Record models and processes all their
  attributes and associations (<tt>has_one</tt>, <tt>has_many</tt>, etc.).
  This information is combined into a single diagram. Because Rails ERD uses
  reflection instead of static analysis, it even recognises meta-programmed
  associations.
</p>
<p>
  The standard output may provide everything you are looking for. But if the
  customisation options are not sufficient, you can still use Rails ERD.
  It has a <a href="/doc/">flexible API</a> that allows you to inspect your models.

  Many of them are generated from <strong>actual applications</strong>.

<h2><a name="refinery">Refinery CMS</a></h2>
<p>
  <a href="http://refinerycms.com/">Refinery</a> is a content management system
  for medium-sized websites. The model diagram generated by Rails ERD is particularly
  clean and convenient.

<h2><a name="gemcutter">Gemcutter</a></h2>

  The Rubygems website is powered by <a href="http://rubygems.org/">Gemcutter</a>.
  This application maintains an overview of all available Ruby libraries that
  are packaged as gems.

<h2><a name="spree">Spree</a></h2>
<p>
  Slightly larger domain models may be difficult to comprehend, even when drawn
  in a diagram. <a href="http://spreecommerce.com/">Spree</a> is an open-source
  e-commerce application with 60 models. If we hide the attributes,
  the diagram gives a clearer overview of the entities themselves. This diagram
  was generated with <tt>attributes=false</tt>.

  Now that we've seen some real entity-relationship diagrams, let's see what
  they're composed of exactly. Consider the following two models, which
  describe <em>countries</em> and their <em>heads of state</em>. They are each associated with
  the other model, so they share a <strong>one-to-one relationship</strong>.
  It is rendered as follows...
</p>

<table class="combined" cellspacing="0"><tr><td>
{% highlight ruby %}
class Country < ActiveRecord::Base
  # A country may or may not have a head of state.
  has_one :head_of_state
end


class HeadOfState < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :country  

  # A head of state always belongs to a country.
  validates_presence_of :country
end
{% endhighlight %}
</td><td><img src="/images/one-to-one.png" class="erd" alt="One-to-one relationship example"/></td></tr></table>

<p>
  Here's another example. One <em>galleon</em> (a medieval warship) has many <em>cannons</em>.
  If we model them in a database, they will share a <strong>one-to-many relationship</strong>.
  This <em>cardinality</em> is represented with a single arrow.
</p>
<table class="combined" cellspacing="0"><tr><td>
{% highlight ruby %}
class Galleon < ActiveRecord::Base
  # Galleons have up to 36 cannons.
  has_many :cannons

  validates_length_of :cannons, :maximum => 36
end


class Cannon < ActiveRecord::Base
  # A cannon belongs to a galleon.
  belongs_to :galleon
end
{% endhighlight %}
</td><td><img src="/images/one-to-many.png" class="erd" alt="One-to-many relationship example"/></td></tr></table>

<p>
  When drawing a <strong>many-to-many relationship</strong>, both ends are represented
  by an arrow.
</p>
<table class="combined" cellspacing="0"><tr><td>
{% highlight ruby %}
# The two models are joined by the join table 'films_genres', 
# with two foreign keys, 'film_id' and 'genre_id'.

class Film < ActiveRecord::Base
  # A film belongs to one or more genres.
  has_and_belongs_to_many :genres
end

class Genre < ActiveRecord::Base
  # Each genre may be applicable for one or more films.
  has_and_belongs_to_many :films
end
{% endhighlight %}
</td><td><img src="/images/many-to-many.png" class="erd" alt="Many-to-many relationship example"/></td></tr></table>

<p>
  <strong>Many-to-many relationships</strong> with a <strong>join model</strong> will be drawn
  together with this third model. The individual relationships are displayed as
  one-to-many relationships. The many-to-many relationship is <em>indirect</em>
  and will be drawn with a dotted line.
</p>
<table class="combined" cellspacing="0"><tr><td>
{% highlight ruby %}
class Wizard < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :spells, :through => :spell_masteries
  has_many :spell_masteries
end

class Spell < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :spell_masteries
end

class SpellMastery < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :wizard
  belongs_to :spell
end
{% endhighlight %}
</td><td><img src="/images/many-to-many-indirect.png" class="erd" alt="Indirect many-to-many relationship example"/></td></tr></table>

<p>
  Rails ERD can also draw <strong>single table inheritance</strong>, often
  referred to as <em>specialization</em>. Specialized entities are displayed
  in grey, because they do not have their own table in the database. An open
  arrow points to their parent entity. Inheritance is not enabled by default,
  set <tt>inheritance=true</tt> to turn it on.
</p>
<table class="combined" cellspacing="0"><tr><td>
{% highlight ruby %}
class Beverage < ActiveRecord::Base
end

class Beer < Beverage
end

class Whisky < Beverage
end
{% endhighlight %}
</td><td><img src="/images/single-inheritance.png" class="erd" alt="Single table inheritance example"/></td></tr></table>

<p>
  A slight variation on specialization is <em>generalization</em>.
  This is achieved when an association is re-used on multiple models, forming
  <strong>polymorphic associations</strong>. The generalized entities are fictional, because
  they are not actual models. They also do not correspond to database tables,
  so they are displayed in grey. Polymorphism is not enabled by default,
  set <tt>polymorphism=true</tt> to turn it on.
</p>

<table class="combined" cellspacing="0"><tr><td>
{% highlight ruby %}
class Barricade < ActiveRecord::Base
  # Defensible structures have many soldiers.
  has_many :soldiers, :as => :defensible
end

class Stronghold < ActiveRecord::Base
  # Defensible structures have many soldiers.
  has_many :soldiers, :as => :defensible
end

class Soldier < ActiveRecord::Base
  # Soldiers belong to a defensible structure.
  belongs_to :defensible, :polymorphic => true
end

{% endhighlight %}
</td><td><img src="/images/polymorphic-belongs-to.png" class="erd" alt="Single table inheritance example"/></td></tr></table>
